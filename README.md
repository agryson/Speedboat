Speedboat
=========

A small (unofficial) plugin to quickly view your Hojoki feed via their mobile site.
Speedboat for Hojoki is a small, unofficial extension that loads Hojoki's mobile site in a dropdown.

While simple, it means that you don't need to keep Hojoki open in a tab to sneak a quick peak at the latest items in your feed.

I'm not linked to Hojoki in any way (except as an enthusiastic user) and this extension doesn't handle your login, it simply loads the mobile site in an iframe so your data is, and always will be, between you and Hojoki.
