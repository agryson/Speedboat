				<p>You can change the default workspace here. Simply put the url for your workspace into the box above and hit save! :D </p>
				<p>The url, which should look something like: <span id="codeSample">http://my.hojoki.com/#/12345</span>, will then be awesomatically clipped and cropped to ensure you always land on that workspace by default (and of course, your data stays between you and hojoki)</p>
				<p>Just empty the box to return to the default setting of loading your principle Hojoki homepage.</p>
